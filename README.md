# Basic_Coin_Flip
Simple coin flip game

This started because my wife and I could not choose between two dinner restaruants one night. I thought how simple it would be to create a coin flip to decide. Yes, Siri, Alexa and other smart devices have this ability as well, which is what we used that night... but it was a fun project to get more practice in python.
